# Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze school district data of standardized test scores in order to provide insights into performance trends and patterns. The analysis was conducted twice due to evidence of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. The first set of analysis includes all student data. The second set of analysis was conducted without including the reading and math grades for all ninth graders at Thomas High School. 

## Results 
* After completing the second set of analysis, the district summary showed that the average math score dropped by .1%, average reading score remained unchanged, % passing math dropped by .2%, % passing reading dropped by .3%, and % overall passing dropped by .1%. 
* After completeing the second set of analysis, the school summary for Thomas High School showed that the average math score by approximately .067%, the average reading score increased by approximately .047%, % passing math decreased by approximately .086%, % passing reading decreased by approximately .29%, and % overall passing decreased by approximately .318%.

* After completing the second set of analysis, the math and reading scores by grade for Thomas High School were replaced with NaN, scores by school spending % overall passing decreased by .2% for the $630-644 bin, scores by school size remained unchanged, and scores by school type remained unchanged. 

## Summary 
After replacing reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaNs, district average math scores dropped, average reading scores dropped, percent of students passing math dropped, and percent of students passing reading dropped. However, the changes to the district summary were fairly unsubstantial as the largest decrease was only .3%.
